<!-- AccordiaNestify -->
AccordiaNestify is a versatile React component designed to bring nested accordion functionality to your web applications. Organize and present hierarchical data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner with ease.

<!-- Installation -->
Install AccordiaNestify in your project using npm:
npm install

<!-- Usage -->
Integrating AccordiaNestify into your project is straightforward. Import the component and provide the necessary props, such as the API endpoint for fetching data.

useEffect(() => {
   <!-- Fetch industries data from the backend API -->
 <!-- Use your own API below endpoints to fetch the respective data you want from your backend -->
    axios.get('') 
   .then((response) => {
        let temp = response?.data?.result?.data
        console.log("res",temp);
        setIndustries(temp);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching industries data:', error);
      });
  }, [title]);
  
  <!-- API Data -->
AccordiaNestify fetches data from an external API to dynamically populate the nested accordions. Ensure your API provides data in the expected structure.
